The US, India, and Brazil are the top three countries with the most confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide. The US is the only country in the world to have reached a peak of over 300,000 new confirmed cases per day, while India and Brazil barely reached 100,000 for single day peak. There may be many differences in testing rates and reporting of cases, which could also help explain the lower case counts for India and Brazil in comparison to the US. India saw it's largest spike in cases between September and October of 2020, while the US saw it's largest peak a few weeks following the 2021 new year. While the cases are continuing to fall in the US, India is starting to see an increasing uptick in cases once again, while Brazil is currently facing it's largest peak in cases at any point during the pandemic, including it's previous peak back at the end of January. One likely possibility could be explained by widespread presence of the Brazil variant (P.1).

While India didn't see it's first spike in new confirmed deaths until mid summer of 2020, the US saw it's first exponential increase in April into May. However, it was during the winter holidays and new year of 2021 that the US saw it's largest peak in new confirmed daily deaths, at one point reaching over 4,000 deaths/day for some time. While India has seen it's daily death count remain fairly low at under 500 deaths/day, it is plateuing and slowly starting to tick back upward again. On the other hand, Brazil is currently facing it's largest spike in daily confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began with over 2,500 deaths/day now here in mid March. While the US has seen a significant drop in deaths, largely in part due to the speedy rollout of vaccines to those most vulnerable, there is still cause for concern with multiple variants taking over and the daily death totals remaining over 1,000. Some major limitations include inconsistent reporting and testing rates which may skew the numbers across all three countries.

# Monthly Number of Deaths (from all causes 2017-2021)

Counts of deaths in the past 12 months were compared with historical trends (from 2017 to March 2021) to determine whether the number of deaths in recent months was significantly higher than expected. Estimates of excess deaths are provided based on the observed number of deaths relative to two different thresholds. The lower end of the excess death estimate range is generated by comparing the observed counts to the upper bound threshold, and a higher end of the excess death estimate range is generated by comparing the observed count to the average expected number of deaths. Reported counts were weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. Death counts were derived from the National Vital Statistics System database that provides the timeliest access to the vital statistics mortality data and may differ slightly from other sources due to differences in completeness, COVID-19 definitions used, data processing, and imputation of missing dates. Weighted estimates may be too high or too low in certain jurisdictions where the timeliness of provisional data has changed in recent weeks relative to prior years.
